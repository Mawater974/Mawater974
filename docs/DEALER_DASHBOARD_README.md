# Dealer Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a Dealer Dashboard to the Mawater974 website, with role-based access control to ensure only approved dealers can access it.

## Features Added

### 1. Dealer Dashboard Page
- Created a new dashboard page at `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Implemented role-based access control to restrict access to users with the 'dealer' role
- Added different views based on dealership status (no showroom, pending, rejected, approved)

### 2. Navbar Integration
- Added a dashboard link in the user dropdown menu
- Made the dashboard link visible only to users with the 'dealer' role

### 3. Automatic Role Assignment
- Updated the `approve_dealership` function to automatically set the user's role to 'dealer' when their dealership is approved
- Created a migration file at `supabase/migrations/20250227_update_approve_dealership_function.sql`

### 4. Multilingual Support
- Added translation keys for all dashboard-related text in both English and Arabic

## How It Works

### Role-Based Access
1. The dashboard checks if the user has the 'dealer' role
2. If not, it shows an access denied message with an option to register as a dealership
3. The navbar only shows the dashboard link to users with the 'dealer' role

### Automatic Role Assignment
When an admin approves a dealership request:
1. The dealership status is updated to 'approved'
2. The user's role is automatically set to 'dealer' in the profiles table
3. This gives the user access to the dealer dashboard

## Testing
To test this implementation:
1. Register a new dealership as a regular user
2. Log in as an admin and approve the dealership request
3. Verify that the user now has the 'dealer' role and can access the dashboard
4. Check that the dashboard shows the correct information for the approved dealership

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed analytics to the dashboard
- Implement notifications for dealership status changes
- Add the ability to manage showroom details from the dashboard
